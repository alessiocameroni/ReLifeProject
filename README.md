This is a Java web application that resambles a social media called ReLife.
This project has been made for the ITT Fauser's 20/21 final exam, developed by **Cameroni Alessio**.

This application has been made solely for educational purposes, this is not a real site - any kind of personal data, such as documents, will not get saved.

## Features
This application mainly talks to a DataBase which uses MariaDB and DBUtility drivers.
This application has:
- User based sessions
- Account creation system
- Password recovery system
- Post creation with image upload
- Comment creation to a specific post
- Show every user and filter user's based off of available cities

This whole application uses english terms for functions, variables and others, however the entire site (as for the User Interface) has been written in Italian.
